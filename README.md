# Voxels#

Voxels is a 3D sandbox game written in Java. The game world is procedurally generated and freely modifiable by the player.

### Features ###

* Varying biomes
* Clouds, caves, trees, sea
* New terrain is continuously generated around the player as they move to new areas.  
Once created areas will stay the same regardless how far away the player moves from them.
* Terrain modification: the player can remove blocks and add blocks to the world.

### Technical features ###

* Terrain generation uses both Perlin and Simplex noise algorithms.
* Data compression for far away terrain to minimize memory usage.
* Greedy meshing to minimize the amount of quads used to draw the terrain.
